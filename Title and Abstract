Title:Introduction to Bayesian Empirical Likelihood
Abstract: 
Bayesian Empirical Likelihood (BEL) is a semiparametric inference procedure where parametric prior is multiplied with nonparametric
empirical likelihood to yield the posterior.
In this talk, I am going to provide a short introduction to Bayesian empirical likelihood (BEL).
I will try to discuss some of its important properties and also show some computational demonstration in R.
